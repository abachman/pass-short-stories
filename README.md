Passphrases are longer, easier to remember, and often more secure than
simple passwords. If you're able to create a passphrase for that new
account, you should do it.

This is a dumb tool to let you generate passstories, which are a handful
of passphrases glommed together and more interesting and probably easier
to remember. They're certainly less secure than good old fashioned
passphrases, though.
